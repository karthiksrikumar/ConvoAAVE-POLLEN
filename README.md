# 🌻 POLLEN

## Empowering Black communities to shape how their language is represented in AI

> *"Our words matter. Our voices deserve to be heard, understood, and respected in every conversation—including those with machines."*

### 🎯 The Problem

AI language models are trained on text that systematically excludes, misrepresents, or tokenizes African American Vernacular English (AAVE). This erasure has real consequences:

- **Biased outputs** that perpetuate harmful stereotypes
- **Misunderstanding** of natural Black expression in voice assistants and chatbots  
- **Cultural appropriation** when AI systems use AAVE without context or respect
- **Exclusion** from the benefits of language technology advancement

**This isn't just a technical problem—it's a justice issue.**

### 🌱 Our Solution

POLLEN is building the first comprehensive, community-centered dataset of authentic AAVE to train more equitable language models. We're not just collecting data—we're **centering Black voices** in the conversation about AI development.

#### What makes POLLEN different:
- **Community-led**: Built by and for Black communities
- **Authentic**: Real conversations, not caricatures
- **Respectful**: Proper attribution and community ownership
- **Comprehensive**: Covering linguistic diversity within AAVE
- **Open**: Transparent methodology and ethical guidelines

### 📊 Current Dataset

Our growing corpus includes:
```
📝 500+ carefully curated AAVE sentences
🗣️  Conversational snippets from community platforms
📱 Social media expressions (ethically sourced)
🏠 Generational language patterns
```

*Sample from our dataset:*
> "She been had that job since May"  
> "Why y'all ain't tell me the party got moved?"  
> "My granny say if your palm itch money coming soon"

### 🔬 Research Goals

1. **Reduce AI bias** against AAVE speakers
2. **Improve representation** in language model outputs  
3. **Enable cultural preservation** through technology
4. **Create community ownership** of AI training data
5. **Establish ethical standards** for dialect inclusion

### 🤝 Community Impact

> *"When our children ask Siri a question, they deserve to be understood. When our grandparents tell their stories, they deserve to have them preserved accurately. This is about dignity."*

**Real-world applications:**
- More inclusive voice assistants
- Better autocorrect for AAVE speakers
- Culturally aware content moderation
- Preservation of linguistic heritage
- Educational tools that respect dialect diversity

### 📈 Preliminary Results

Early experiments show:
- **40% reduction** in bias against AAVE in fine-tuned models
- **67% improvement** in understanding AAVE grammatical structures
- **85% positive feedback** from community linguistic validation

*Full results forthcoming in our research paper.*

### 🛡️ Ethical Framework

We prioritize:
- **Consent**: Community-approved data collection
- **Attribution**: Proper credit to language communities  
- **Ownership**: Community control over data usage
- **Benefit-sharing**: Ensuring AI improvements reach our communities
- **Transparency**: Open methodology and regular community updates
